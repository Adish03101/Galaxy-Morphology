# Galaxy-Morphology
In this project We predicted different morphological shapes of galaxy based on the data of Galaxy-Zoo-2

## Basic 
* Used Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) on the dataset to predict the shape of the galaxy
* Parameters for the classifying different types of galaxies was based on the reaserch paper: **Machine and Deep Learning applied to galaxy morphology - A
comparative study**
* Trained our own CNN model on the data set to get predictions as well as employed pretrained models 
* Pretrained models such as InceptionV3, ResNet50 and Xception were used on which we trained our data using Artificial Neural Network
* Different types of classification features were used classify more types of galaxies such as Lenticular, Elliptical and Spiral

 ## Results
  * The self trained model boasts an accuracy of 94.7%
  * Pretraiend Models Have Accuracy over 93% respectively <!--Har model ka alag alag daalna?-->
